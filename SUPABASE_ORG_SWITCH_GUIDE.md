# How to Switch to Your Correct Supabase Organization

## Quick Fix: Switch Organizations in Supabase Dashboard

1. **In the Supabase project selector (the modal you're seeing):**
   - Look for an organization switcher at the top
   - Click on "neocryptoquant" (current organization)
   - Switch to "TabbieAI" organization

2. **Alternative method:**
   - Close this modal
   - Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Look for an organization dropdown in the top navigation
   - Select "TabbieAI" instead of "neocrypto"

3. **Once in the correct organization:**
   - You should see your existing project with all your data
   - Select that project to connect

## If You Can't Find the Organization Switcher

1. **Check your organization memberships:**
   - Go to your Supabase account settings
   - Look for "Organizations" section
   - Make sure you're a member of the "TabbieAI" organization

2. **If you're not a member:**
   - You may need to be invited to the TabbieAI organization
   - Or transfer the project from TabbieAI to neocrypto

## Current Situation

- ‚úÖ Your data is in: `/TabbieAI` organization
- ‚ùå You're currently viewing: `/neocrypto` organization
- üéØ Solution: Switch to the TabbieAI organization

## No Code Changes Needed

Once you switch to the correct organization and select your existing project, everything should work as-is because:
- Your project URL and API keys remain the same
- All your database tables and data are preserved
- Your current code configuration is already correct

The issue is just that you're looking in the wrong organization folder!
