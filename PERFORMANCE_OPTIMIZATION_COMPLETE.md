### Caching Strategy
- **Static Data**: 1 hour cache (tournaments, profiles)
- **Dynamic Data**: 5 minutes cache (teams, rounds)
- **Real-time Data**: 30 seconds cache (draws, results)
- **User Data**: 10 minutes cache with background refresh

### Error Handling
- **Centralized**: All errors go through ErrorHandler utility
- **User-Friendly**: Contextual error messages
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
